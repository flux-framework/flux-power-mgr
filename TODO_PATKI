- Document use of Flux Proxy on 4 nodes for Lassen
- Document use on Quartz
- Add hostname to the msg, so we know whom we received from. 
- Add GPU, CPU, memory power for the job
- Test power capping on multiple nodes on Lassen
- Allow for running infinitely long in the background; don't stop at 6 samples.
    -- How do we scale this? Where can the data reside in the future? 
    -- Can we dump the KVS contents after the job finishes executing?
- How do we measure overhead of communication as well as variorum API? 
- Scaling tests on 256+ nodes, what's the overhead?

- Test with LBANN on multiple nodes, collect power data
    -- Start with lenet.py, extend to the ATOM example, ask for input decks.
    -- Flux scripts for LBANN (autogenenerate at some point using the launcher interface in LBANN) 

- Does this work correctly for odd number of ranks? 

- Cleanup code further, more meaningful names for variables. 

- This is the system-level monitor, we need to also implement one where we can associate power with jobs.

- Verify power values are correct
- Test with an application that is running on the 4 nodes.
- Add a proper readme to explain the algorithm, and expected output and KVS check.
- Discuss with Mark on how to turn this into a flux module for flux core.
